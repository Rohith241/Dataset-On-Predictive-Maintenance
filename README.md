# Dataset-On-Predictive-Maintenance
Dataset that contains values about vibration levels, torque, process temperature and Air temperature.
This dataset provides information about Vibration levels , torque, process temperature and Fault.

The dataset in the image is a spreadsheet containing information about engine performance. The spreadsheet has the following variables:

UDI: This is likely a unique identifier for each engine. Product ID: This could be a specific code or identifier for the engine model. Type: This indicates the type of engine, possibly categorized by fuel type (e.g., M - motor, L - liquid). Air temperature (K): This is the air temperature in Kelvin around the engine. Process temperature [K]: This is the internal temperature of the engine during operation, measured in Kelvin. Speed (rpm): This is the rotational speed of the engine in revolutions per minute. Torque (Nm): This is the twisting force exerted by the engine, measured in Newton meters. Vibration Levels: This could be a measure of the engine's vibration intensity. Operational Hours: This is the total number of hours the engine has been operational. Tailure Type: This indicates the type of failure the engine experienced, if any. Rotational: This might be a specific type of failure related to the engine's rotation. This dataset could be used for various analytical purposes related to engine performance and maintenance. Here are some examples:

Identifying patterns of engine failure: By analyzing the data, you could identify correlations between specific variables (e.g., air temperature, operational hours) and engine failures. This could help predict potential failures and schedule preventative maintenance. Optimizing engine performance: By analyzing the data, you could identify the operating conditions (e.g., temperature, speed) that lead to optimal engine performance. This could help improve fuel efficiency and engine lifespan. Comparing engine types: The data could be used to compare the performance and efficiency of different engine types under various operating conditions. Building predictive models: The data could be used to train machine learning models to predict engine failures, optimize maintenance schedules, and improve overall engine performance. It's important to note that the specific value of this dataset would depend on the context and the intended use case. For example, if you are only interested in a specific type of engine or a particular type of failure, you might need to filter or subset the data accordingly.
